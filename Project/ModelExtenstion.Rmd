```{r}

#P <- 1:10 

P[1] = 100

#D <- 1:10

D[1] = 2

#Plant growth rate without deer.
a = 2
#Plant deer encounter rate
c = 0.01
#efficiency for deer to convert plant to deer
e = 0.10
#mortality rate deer
f = 0.01
#hunting rate deer
h = 0

for (i in 1:10) {
  
  P[i+1] <- P[i] + a*P[i] - c*P[i]*D[i]
  D[i+1] <- D[i] + e*c*P[i]*D[i] - f*D[i] - h

}

print(D)
print(P)

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(D)
plot(P)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
